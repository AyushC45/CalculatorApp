# CalculatorApp
This is my calculator app

I designed this app so that it would do the basic 4 operations, along with a clear function which wipes the displayed string.
The calculator requires user input for firstNum until an operation is pressed. Once an operation is pressed, it will require user input until the second number is entered followed by a "=" sign.
